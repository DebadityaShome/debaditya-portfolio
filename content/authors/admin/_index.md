I'm a graduate student pursuing MASc in AI (research) at Queen's University. My research interests include Generative models, Self-supervised learning, Multi-modality, and learning universal representations of time-series. I'm an author of 10+ publications, encompassing a total of 100+ citations. Apart from research, I have prior experience in Data engineering and deploying Machine learning models at scale on cloud/serverless to integrate with real-world products/applications. 

Achievements:

- Vector Scholarship in AI
- MITACS Globalink Graduate Fellow
